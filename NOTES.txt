1. Not clear on how to use secret key at first glance as the link could not be found
2. For some reason, could not get the room join working. It always complains about you must join the room first even I have implemented the room join logic.
3. there is strange IE error/warning/popup which I don't know and cause out of sync
4. notice delay in the cell movement when using Key for the cell position updates. After switching to channel, the delay problem reduced significantly.
